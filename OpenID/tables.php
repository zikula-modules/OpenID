     * claimed_openid   The claimed identifier, as normalized through the OpenID normalization process described in
     *                      section 7.2 of verion 2.0 of the OpenID specification. A Zikula user account may have
     *                      zero, one, or many claimed identifier(s), but no two claimed identifiers should be equivalent
     *                      either for the same uid or for different uids (claimed identifiers must be unique).
     * is_primary       A boolean value indicating whether this is the primary claimed identifier or not. If it is the only
     *                      claimed identifier for a given uid, then this must be true. If several claimed identifiers exist
     *                      for a given uid, then one (and only one) must have this flag set to true for that uid. If (in error)
