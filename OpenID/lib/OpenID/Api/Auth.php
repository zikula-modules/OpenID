     * Merely that enough information be provided in the authinfo array to unequivocally authenticate the user. For
     * most authenticating authorities this will be the equivalent of a user name and password, but--again--there
     * is no restriction here. This is not, however, a "user exists in the system" function. It is expected that
     * the authenticating authority validate what ever is used as a password or the equivalent thereof.

     * authenticating authority to authenticate the authinfo provided. No "login" should take place as a result of
     * this authentication.
     *
     * This function may be called to initially authenticate a user during the registration process, or may be called
     * for a user already logged in to re-authenticate his password for a security-sensitive operation. This function
     * should merely authenticate the user, and not perform any additional login-related processes.
     *

     * Zikula user account. It does not return a Zikula user id (uid).
