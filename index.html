                <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                <p>Beginning with version 1.3.0, Zikula introduced it's <em>Authentication API</em>, which allows a module to provide authentication services
                    in addition to those provided by the core Users module. A module providing authentication services allows a user to log into a Zikula
                    site using credentials (something like, but not limited to, a user name and password) that are not managed by Zikula's core Users
                    module. In addition, an authentication module can enable its authentication method(s) for registration, meaning that a new user can 
                    request a new web site account using those credentials instead of creating a User name and password.</p>
                <p>The <em><strong>OpenID for Zikula</strong></em> module allows a user to use his OpenID as his credentials for both logging into, and
                    for registering a new account with a Zikula-based web site.</p>

                <h3>Version 1.0.0</h3>
                <p id="plannedrelease-1-0-0">Planned Release:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shortly after general availability of Zikula core version 1.3.0.</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="plannedfeatures-1-0-0">Planned Features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full implementation of the Authentication API, including registration.</li>
                    <li>Basic OpenID authentication workflow for a fixed number of major OpenID providers.</li>
                    <li>Striving to support both unencrypted and SSL connections to OpenID providers, but see <a href="#currentissues-1-0-0">Current Issues</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="currentissues-1-0-0">Current Issues Affecting This Version:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We initially used the <code>php-openid</code> library from JanRain, as it appeared to be the better implementation, the 
                        most stable of options, and the option with the least number of external dependencies. Unfortunately, it appears as though
                        JanRain has abandoned the library as of late 2010. The remaining otherwise viable options were the Zend library and the PEAR
                        library. The Zend library has not been updated in a while either. The PEAR library comes with a plethora of additional 
                        PEAR library dependencies. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Version 1.1.0</h3>
                <p id="plannedfeatures-1-1-0">Planned Features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Additional administrative options and features.</li>
                    <li>Additional OpenID providers.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
                <p>This project uses the collaborator/contributor model for developer participation. Essentially, anyone can contribute to this
                    project!</p>
                <p>In the collaborator/contributor model, everyone is a contributor by default. To contribute to the project, fork the repository,
                    start a new branch in your fork for the changes you'd like to make, push that branch back to your forked repository here on
                    GitHub, and issue a pull request. Someone with direct commit access to the main repository (a collaborator) will review
                    your pull request. If it is acceptable, then your changes will be merged into the master branch (or an appropriate version 
                    or task branch) of the main repository.</p>
                <p>Collaborators are those who have made a special commitment of their time and energy to this project, and have agreed to work
                    toward the goals of the project as outlined in the roadmap. They have been granted permission to commit directly to the 
                    main repository, and also have the ability to fulfill pull requests. The best way to become a collaborator in this project
                    is to take on several issues in the issues tracker as a contributor. Resolve those issues and make pull requests. As your
                    pull requests are accepted, the team of collaborators gains confidence in your ability to work on the project. At some
                    point let one of the collaborators know that you'd be interested in getting direct commit access, and your request will 
                    be evaluated by the team.</p>
